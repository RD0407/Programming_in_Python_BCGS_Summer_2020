If two dimensions are equal, or if one of them equals 1, the comparison continues. If one of the dimensions in this case is 1 and the other is larger than 1, the smaller array is stretched *naturally* to match the bigger one. Otherwise, you'll see a ValueError raised (saying something like \"operands could not be broadcast together with shapes ...\").\n",
